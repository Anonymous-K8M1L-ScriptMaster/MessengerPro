# MessengerPro
An Xposed module with extends Facebook Messenger with a bunch of exciting features

## Warning
This module is still in alpha phase, so you will most likely encounter bugs. Please open a github issue if you do.  
It will work if and only if use **Messenger version 350.0.0.7.89 Android 9.0+ release** (download from [here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/facebook-2/messenger/messenger-350-0-0-7-89-release/facebook-messenger-350-0-0-7-89-android-apk-download/)). This is mainly because Messenger code is obfuscated. It *may* support more versions in the future, but as of now, you should use this version.
